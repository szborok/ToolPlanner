# My MERN App - Backend

This is the backend part of the MERN stack application. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend connects to MongoDB Atlas and serves as the API for the frontend application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd my-mern-app/backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Update the MongoDB connection string in `src/config/db.js` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

### Running the Application

To start the backend server, run:
```
npm start
```

The server will run on port 5000 by default.

### API Endpoints

- Define your API endpoints in the `src/routes` directory.
